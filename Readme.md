#Backbone

##Intro

###Overview

Created by Jeremy Ashkenas, released in 2010.

"When working on a web application that involves a lot of JavaScript, one of the first things you learn is to stop tying your data to the DOM. It's all too easy to create JavaScript applications that end up as tangled piles of jQuery selectors and callbacks, all trying frantically to keep data in sync between the HTML UI, your JavaScript logic, and the database on your server. For rich client-side applications, a more structured approach is often helpful." **-Backbonejs.org**

Applications that use backbone include:

* Airbnb
* Digg
* Foursquare
* Grooveshark
* Groupon
* Hulu
* Linkedin
* Pandora
* Pinterest
* Soundcloud
* Trello
* USA Today
* Wordpress

###Dependancies

* JQuery & Underscore


###Purpose

* Organizes your front-end javascript with structure.
* Uses Models to synchronize & template data between the server and client.

##Components

###Models

* Represents data
* Models are the heart of the application; they hold the data that is passed from the server to the view.

###Views

* Templates your data from your models
* Views display data from your models

###Collections

* Sets of models
* Can communicate with your server


##Example App
In this project you can find an example html file that communicates with a rails backend and implements all of the above components.
